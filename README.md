### Hue
Hue (denoted as h) defines the color itself, for
example, red in distinction to blue or yellow. The
values for the hue axis run from 0–360° beginning
and ending with red and running through green,
blue and all intermediary colors like greenish-blue,
orange, purple, etc.

###  Saturation
Saturation (denoted as s) indicates the degree to which the hue differs from a neutral gray. The values run from
0%, which is no color saturation, to 100%, which is the fullest saturation of a given hue at a given percentage of
illumination.

### Luminance
Luminance (denoted as l) indicates the level of illumination. The values run as percentages; 0% appears black
(no light) while 100% is full illumination, which washes out the color (it appears white).
